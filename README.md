This is the Landing page for this system.

```
http://localhost:8000/entry/host/
```

This is the Host registration page. Here Host will enter his details and submit the form, after successful registration it will show the successful registration message.

```
http://localhost:8000/entry/checkin/
```

This is for Guest check in. Here Guest will select the host from the list of all the hosts and fill the form. After successful registration one mail and one SMS will be send to corresponding host with user's details, and it will generate a token for the guest to use it while check out. That is the guest will have to only fill the token while checking out and the system will verify him/her and then send all the required details to the host through both phone SMS and Email.

The Token is of length 7 characters and it is unique, I have created my own unique token generator function.

```
http://localhost:8000/entry/checkout/
```

This page is for Check out. The guest  will have to only submit the token which was given to him/her while checking in and all the guest's details including host name, and address will be sent out to the guest through both Email and phone SMS.

For Twilio to work on your machine:

1. First of all install twilio on your machine by the above given command (on ubuntu)
2. Buy a number on twilio website so that you can use it to send SMS on any number which are verified on twilio(on trial version, because I used only trial version of it)
3. Then Set these two things in "entryrecord.settings.py"
    	1. account_sid = "your twilio account_sid"
